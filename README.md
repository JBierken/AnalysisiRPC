## Analysis

### Where is the data and How do I produce it ?

We have two data types: raw (.dat) and ROOT (.root) version  
Depending on the data taking location our raw and root files are stored in different folders.  
At the moment we are taking data in Gif++, we are using the machine in the preparation area.  
You can access the machine (acqcmsmu01) via ssh: ssh acqcms@128.141.151.164  

Raw files are stored in this direcotry: /data/gifOctober/raw/  
Since there is no root installed at the moment in this machine we use the computer in beam dump area. 
You can access this computer via : ssh acqcmsmu@PCLINUX-LYOCMS03     

If you don't have the root file for necessary run in LYOCMS03 machine in directory /data/gifOctober/roottrees/, please produce it.
After you decide which one to run.  
Production:  
1 ) login to LYOCMS03 machine.
2 ) If you want to work on Scan ID 508 for example, you need to copy raw files from LYOCMS01 to 03:  
scp acqcms@128.141.151.164://data/gifOctober/raw/*SN_508* /data/gifOctober/raw/  
3 ) Converting raw file to ROOT file   
```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalyseFEBV2  
source init.sh
```
Edit the produce.sh for example change the Scan ID (variable y) , or change the MAx Trigger Value (Variable z).
```
sh produce.sh
```

### How do I produce DQM plots ?  

Let's say you want to check dqm plots HV point 1 , Scan ID 508 and with 1000 Max Trigger:
```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalysisiRPC/
source init.sh
root -l 'dqm_beamdump.C(1,508,"/data/gifOctober/roottrees/")'
```
### How do I run analysis code ? 

Let's say you want to analyse HV point 5 , Scan ID 508 and with 5000 Max Trigger:

```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalysisiRPC/
source init.sh
root -l 'run_ana_FEBv2.C(5,508,"/data/gifOctober/roottrees/")'
```

Before to run a Sacan ID check if this scan is included in the CalibAlig.h file, as well as, the time calibration.

### How do I obtain efficiency curves ? 
Everytime, you run the 'run_ana_FEBv2.C' you will obtain a txt file in outputs directory. Once ou have all txt files (for all HVs) 
You need to provide as a first argument the Scan ID, second the numbers of HVs, and third the list of all HVs values separated by comma, do not forget that this numbers are float, then put a dot after the interger. 
 
For example, for ScanId 508:
```
root -l -b -q 'eff_curve.C(508,7,6.,6.5,6.9,7.,7.1,7.2,7.5)'
```
